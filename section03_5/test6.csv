"Work is progressing on a program to modernise ANZ’s banking systems under its ANZx transformation program, with a trial of the systems slated for Q2 2021,  understands. As first reported by  ANZx will be piloted by as many as 150 bank staff in April, ahead of a wider launch. the bank was working on the ambitious transformation program in November 2019, which ANZ hopes will deliver a tenfold improvement in speed and digital capability.The technology side of the ANZx project is being led by Chris Venter, GM for Australian business transformation technology; Peter Dalton, the bank's managing director for customer experience and digital channels, is a co-lead on the project.Venter told the bank was “effectively building a new banking platform” which would be “cloud-native [and] API-first”.Designing and building the next-generation customer-centric banking platform involves overhauling the bank’s existing products and services.ANZ has selected technology from the Salesforce ecosystem, including tools from MuleSoft, to develop new capabilities.Salesforce will be used to bring customer data together into a single place, which will improve service and compliance with handling and addressing customers’ complaints in a timely manner.In addition to Salesforce tools, some of the cloud components will come from ANZ’s , a central capability within ANZ that is taking responsibility for cloud services.",https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https%3a%2f%2fi.nextmedia.com.au%2fNews%2fanz_bank.jpg&w=480&c=0&s=1,ANZ preps for new banking platform pilot
"Australia’s privacy watchdog has suggested outlawing “certain uses of data” under the consumer data right to mitigate the threat posed by ‘big tech’ companies if they were able to get their hands on detailed banking data.The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) raised fears that ‘big tech’ companies could exploit consent mechanisms in the consumer data right (CDR) scheme to build even more detailed digital profiles of individuals.The OAIC has asked a senate committee examining financial technology issues to consider establishing more ‘no go zones’ - or to explicitly prohibit some uses and disclosures of data - before the first ‘big tech’ firm gains CDR accreditation.“The CDR is currently open to large non-bank technology companies, such as Google or Facebook, to become accredited under the CDR system,” the OAIC said in a submission [].“We note the participation of these entities in the CDR may raise a range of significant privacy risks, given the volume of data already held by these entities. “For example, it would be open to accredited data recipients to ask consumers to consent to combining sensitive financial data with the extensive amount of personal information already collected by these large technology companies (through social media profiles, messages, emails, search histories, and other sources), to deliver products or services. “This would allow a large non-bank technology company accredited under the CDR to build profiles of individual consumers, and to derive and provide deep and rich insights into those individuals.”While acknowledging that ‘big tech’ would still need a consumer’s consent in order to access the banking data, the OAIC questioned whether consumers could “provide fully informed and voluntary consent to certain data handling practices” by ‘big tech’ companies.Already, the OAIC said there were “information handling practices” used in existing ‘big tech’ business models “which do not meet the expectations of the Australian community.”The office raised examples such as “inappropriate surveillance or monitoring” of individuals through smartphones and smart home devices; scraping personal information from online platforms; and the “collection, use and disclosure of location information”.The OAIC said the CDR scheme had “a number of protections” aimed at preventing privacy-invasive use cases, but expressed a view that more could be done.“In the OAIC’s view consideration could be given to whether further strengthening of the consumer protections under the CDR is required to prohibit certain uses of data under the CDR, where these uses do not meet the expectations of the Australian community,” it said.“The OAIC notes that there are many other complex regulatory matters to consider in relation to such a proposal, which go beyond privacy.“The OAIC therefore recommends that the committee consider whether there are specific uses or disclosures of data that should be prohibited in the CDR (rather than relying on an individual’s ability to consent to protect them).”There are currently no 'big tech' companies accredited as data recipients under the CDR; as it is, there are very few recipients at all.The government has indicated in recent months it intends to encourage the entry of more participants into the CDR scheme, .",https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https%3a%2f%2fi.nextmedia.com.au%2fNews%2fsurveillance_privacy_data.jpg&w=480&c=0&s=1,OAIC urges prep for 'big tech' entry into consumer data right
"Tyro Payments will independently review its policies, procedures and systems after sending more than 150,000 spam email and SMS messages to consumers without an unsubscribe function.The financial services company has entered into a  with the Australian Communications and Media Authority for the breach of the .Tyro was alerted to the breach in March 2020 following a complaint to the communications watchdog and shortly thereafter commenced an internal investigation into its compliance.The investigation found that between April 2019 and March 2020 the customer engagement team sent emails and SMS messages without a functional unsubscribe function.Tyro has acknowledged that “its systems, processes and practices were not adequate”, and has since taken action to implement changes such as system improvements to “remove manual processes”.As part of the undertaking, the company will be required to engage an independent consultant to review the procedures, policies, training and systems relating to its compliance with the Spam Act.It will also be expected to implement all recommendations made by the independent consultant, unless agreed with the ACMA or the work has already been completed.The ACMA will be able to apply to the Federal Court to have the undertaking enforced if any breach by Tyro occurs, with other levers such as payment or compensation also available to the court.“We appreciate that Tyro has come to us with these commitments,” ACMA deputy chair Creina Chapman said in a statement.“Although it’s clear that its practices and systems were not adequate to comply with the spam laws, its actions since receiving our alert are appropriate to address the issues.“However, the ACMA will not hesitate to pursue more serious enforcement action, including financial penalties, in appropriate cases.“We will also be actively monitoring Tyro’s compliance with the spam laws and its commitments.”Chapman also placed the financial services sector on notice following Tyro’s breach, noting that businesses have paid more than $1.7 million for ACMA-issued infringement notices in 12 months.“The Spam Act has been in place for 17 years and provides important protections to consumers,” she said.“Australians should not receive marketing messages they haven’t consented to, and they must be able to easily withdraw their consent when they choose.”",https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https%3a%2f%2fi.nextmedia.com.au%2fNews%2f20171103094408_CRN-spam-email-security-iStock_000009577861_Large.jpg&w=480&c=0&s=1,"Tyro agrees to independent review after sending 150,000 spam messages"
"Microsoft was breached in the massive hacking campaign disclosed by US officials this week, according to people familiar with the matter, adding a top technology target to a growing list of vital government agencies.The Redmond, Washington, company used the widely deployed networking management software from SolarWinds, which was used in the suspected Russian attacks on US agencies and others. It also had its own products leveraged to further the attacks on others, the people said.Reuters could not immediately determine how many Microsoft users were affected by the tainted products. The Department of Homeland Security, which said earlier Thursday that the hackers used multiple methods of entry, is continuing to investigate.In response to the report, Microsoft said that ""like other SolarWinds customers, we have been actively looking for indicators of this actor and can confirm that we detected malicous SolarWinds binaries in our environment, which we isolated and removed"".""We have not found evidence of access to production services or customer data. Our investigations, which are ongoing, have found absolutely no indications that our systems were used to attack others,"" a .The FBI and other agencies have scheduled a classified briefing for members of Congress Friday.The US Energy Department also said they have evidence hackers gained access to their networks as part of a massive cyber campaign.  had earlier reported the National Nuclear Security Administration, which manages the country’s nuclear weapons stockpile, was targeted.An Energy Department spokeswoman said malware “has been isolated to business networks only” and had not impacted US national security, including the NNSA.The Department of Homeland Security said in a bulletin on Thursday the spies had used other techniques besides corrupting updates of network management software by SolarWinds which is used by hundreds of thousands of companies and government agencies.“The SolarWinds Orion supply chain compromise is not the only initial infection vector this APT actor leveraged,” said DHS’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, referring to “advanced persistent threat” adversaries.CISA urged investigators not to assume their organisations were safe if they did not use recent versions of the SolarWinds software, while also pointing out that the hackers did not exploit every network they did gain access too.CISA said it was continuing to analyse the other avenues used by the attackers. So far, the hackers are known to have at least monitored email or other data within the US departments of Defense, State, Treasury, Homeland Security and Commerce.As many as  that contained a back door. Since the campaign was discovered, software companies have cut off communication from those back doors to the computers maintained by the hackers.But the attackers might have installed additional ways of maintaining access in what some have called the biggest hack in a decade.For that reason, officials said that security teams should communicate through special channels to ensure that their own detection and remediation efforts are not being monitored.The Department of Justice, FBI and Defense Department, among others, have moved routine communication onto classified networks that are believed not to have been breached, according to two people briefed on the measures. They are assuming that the nonclassified networks have been accessed.CISA and private companies including FireEye, which was the first to discover and reveal it had been hacked, have released a series of clues for organisations to look for to see if they have been hit.But the attackers are very careful and have deleted logs, or electronic footprints or which files they have accessed. That makes it hard to know what has been taken.Some major companies have issued carefully worded statements saying that they have “no evidence” that they were penetrated, but in some cases that may only be because the evidence was removed.In most networks, the attackers would also have been able to create false data, but so far it appears they were interested only in obtaining real data, people tracking the probes said.Meanwhile, members of Congress are demanding more information about what may have been taken and how, along with who was behind it. The House Homeland Security Committee and Oversight Committee announced an investigation Thursday, while senators pressed to learn whether individual tax information was obtained.In a statement, President-elect Joe Biden said he would “elevate cybersecurity as an imperative across the government” and “disrupt and deter our adversaries” from undertaking such major hacks.",https://i.nextmedia.com.au/Utils/ImageResizer.ashx?n=https%3a%2f%2fi.nextmedia.com.au%2fNews%2f20201030120603_0_0_0_0_70__News_20200723110935_microsoft1.jpg&w=480&c=0&s=1,Microsoft breached in suspected Russian hack using SolarWinds
